This is actually a BouKiCHi project (https://github.com/BouKiCHi) and (http://clogging.blog57.fc2.com/), but since I cannot find its repostory anymore,  I would like to share here.

Professional Music Driver (PMD) is a music driver developed by M.Kajihara which utilizes MML (Music Macro Language) to create music files for most japanese computers of the 80's and early 90's.
PMD can be used to make music for the PC-98, PC-88, X68000, and FM Towns.
